    "- `batch_size`: Again, I only tried a couple of values - 64 and 128 - with no noticeable difference in convergence rate, and finally used the larger value, assuming that would train faster.\n",
    "- `num_epochs`: I normally use 10, but went with 16 on my penultimate run as I noticed that the network trained slowly while trying different hyperparameters. Since I had started my vocab dict at 1 instead of 0, I had CUDA errors when generating scripts, so when I changed that I switched to 8 epochs for a little overhead past 6, which would likely be more than sufficient as the loss dipped below 3.5 and more or less bottomed out in epoch 6.\n",
    "- `learning_rate`: Used the value of 0.001 used in exercises. I did try 0.01 and 0.1, but the loss appeared to bounce around more than with 0.001.\n",
    "`embedding_dim`, `hidden_dim`: I used similar values to those used in the Sentiment RNN exercise, but bumped the `embedding_dim` up to 512 from 400 since powers of two are a thing.\n",
    "`n_layers`: I initially set this at 2, but bumped it up to three to see if the model converged faster. It did not seem to make much of a difference in two epochs, but I left it at 3 since the training time did not seem to suffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest change I made to get the model to converge faster and get loss below 3.5 was to eliminate dropout and the sigmoid activation in the model."
